## 🔧 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

### Issue #1: Missing Dependencies ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**

- `mysql2` not in package.json (but required by server.js)
- `body-parser` not in package.json (but required by server.js)
- `express-session` not in package.json (but required by server.js)

**Solution:**

- Updated `backend/package.json` with all required dependencies
- Ran `npm install` to install all packages
- Verified all 10 packages now installed correctly

**Result:**

```
✅ bcryptjs@3.0.3
✅ body-parser@1.20.4
✅ cors@2.8.6
✅ dotenv@16.6.1
✅ express-session@1.19.0
✅ express@4.22.1

✅ multer@1.4.5-lts.2
✅ mysql2@3.16.3
✅ nodemon@3.1.11
```

### Issue #2: Logo Path References ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**

- `admin.html` referenced `./OIP.webp` (incorrect relative path)
- `author.html` referenced `./OIP.webp` (incorrect relative path)
- Should be `public/OIP.webp` to match project structure

**Solution:**

- Updated admin.html logo references (2 instances)
- Updated author.html logo references (2 instances)
- Now correctly points to `public/OIP.webp`

**Verification:**

- Logo will display correctly on all pages
- No broken image references

### Issue #3: Messy .env Configuration ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**

- .env file had duplicate entries
- Confusing comments and unused Supabase configs
- Not organized by sections
- Unclear which values need to be changed

**Solution:**

- Reorganized into clear sections:
  - SERVER CONFIGURATION
  - DATABASE CONFIGURATION
  - AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
  - ADMIN ACCOUNT
  - FILE UPLOAD SETTINGS
  - EMAIL CONFIGURATION (optional)
  - PRODUCTION SETTINGS

**Result:**

```
✅ Clean, well-documented .env
✅ All required vars clearly labeled
✅ Optional configs in separate section
✅ Comments explain each setting
```

---

### Issue #4: Package.json Missing Author Info ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**

- Empty author field
- Wrong test script reference

**Solution:**

- Added author: "Babcock University"
- Fixed test script to use existing test-db.js
- Removed non-existent migrate script
